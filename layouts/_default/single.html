    {{/* Ok so here is how you avoid code duplication here. You have
         three options here.

       1. Use partial templates. This is the prefered solution
          according to Haiku and 4o. BUT, it is a pain to transfer
          variables to the template. Normally, the syntax for a template
          is:

            {\{  template your_template . }}
        
          (Escaping this, otherwise Hugo screams.)
          But here, we need extra args (glob, name, etc). A solution is
          to pass the page AND the context. This kinda works, for the
          price of horrible argument syntax and an extra file. See this:

            https://mertbakir.gitlab.io/hugo/pass-arguments-in-partials-hugo/

      2. Use shortcodes. My understanding is that it's basically the
         same as templates, but shortcodes are to be used in contents,
         not in layout definitions. And indeed, I tried to use  a
         template with

           {\{< my_shortcode >}}

         (Once again escaping.)
         and Hugo screamed at me because they didn't like the < and >.
         And indeed:

           https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/highlight-html-unexpected-in-command-built-site-for-language-en/4468

         In any case, I don't really care, as the problems I have with
         partials, I'd have with shortcodes.

      3. Good ol' loop. Yeah, that's the one. */}}

    {{/* So here, there are multiple options. Of course, the three file
         resources must be treated differently, as they each are
         displayed differently. An option is to range over a hashmap
         where the keys are something like "résumé.md" and the values
         are the corresponding "summary". HOWEVER, when iterating over
         a map, Hugo does so by ascending order. I never asked for this,
         but this is the default. Thank you Hugo. Thank you so much for
         taking this initiative, and making it so obvious in the naming
         of the `range` iterator:

           https://gohugo.io/functions/go-template/range/#maps

         So what I'm gonna do, even though it's ~~horrendous~~ French,
         is iterating over a good ol' slice, and then use the
         `nth-child` CSS selector.
